# raygui

* Projects that use vcpkg to get raygui, raylib, GLFW:
  * `00SampleProject` – Empty raygui project
  * `01HelloCounter` – HelloCounter (simple counter project for understanding the basic principles of the IMGUI paradigm)

## Running raygui with raylib, vcpkg

Same steps as with [Dear ImGui](../01DearImGui/README.MD#running-dear-imgui-v1919-with-opengl3-glfw-glew-vcpkg).
