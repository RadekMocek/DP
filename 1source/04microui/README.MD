# microui

* Projects that use vcpkg to get _SDL2_:
  * `00SampleProject` – Empty microui project
  * `01HelloCounter` – HelloCounter (simple counter project for understanding the basic principles of the IMGUI paradigm)
  * `02Playground` – Project for testing microui features as part of the research

## Running microui with SDL2, vcpkg

Same steps as with [Dear ImGui](../01DearImGui/README.MD#running-dear-imgui-v1919-with-opengl3-glfw-glew-vcpkg).
